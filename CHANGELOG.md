## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Flagship modular Counter smart contract containing `initialize(owner)`, `increment()`, `decrement()`, `reset()`, `get_count()`, and `get_owner()` across dedicated files (`lib.rs`, `storage.rs`, `event.rs`, `error.rs`).
- Robust unit tests in `contracts/counter/src/test.rs` verifying contract errors, bounds limits, state manipulation, and event audits.
- CLI automation command scripts `scripts/invoke-counter.ps1` and `scripts/invoke-counter.sh` to initialize, query, and mutate contract states on Testnet.
- New root package manager script triggers: `pnpm build:contracts`, `pnpm optimize`, `pnpm deploy:counter`, and `pnpm invoke:counter`.
- Root `docker-compose.yml` to support declarative local Stellar Quickstart node management.
- Cross-platform PowerShell helper script `scripts/setup-local-node.ps1` for Windows developers.
- Root `package.json` command script `"node:local": "docker compose up -d"` for quick start-ups.
- Persistent ledger data volume mapping in local docker-compose configuration.
- Flagship multi-party **Escrow smart contract** (`contracts/escrow`) implementing agreement lifecycles (create, fund, release, refund, cancel), state transitions, deadline verification, and event emissions.
- Detailed unit test suite in `contracts/escrow/src/test.rs` covering all happy paths, boundary checks, unauthorized operations, and status validations.
- CLI automation scripts `scripts/invoke-escrow.sh` and `scripts/invoke-escrow.ps1` supporting deployment, validation, and full execution lifecycles on Stellar Testnet.
- Added Next.js 15 Escrow dashboard page (`apps/web/src/app/escrow/page.tsx`) with integrated Freighter connection, creation forms, lifecycle management controls, and real-time execution event logs.
- Added `EscrowClient` exports in `@stellar-starter-kit/contracts` package.

### Changed

- Migrated frontend counter demo (`apps/web/src/app/counter/page.tsx`) to compile-safe `client.get_count()` calls.
- Overhauled code playground (`CodePlayground.tsx`) on the landing page to showcase `CounterClient` integration snippet.
- Synchronized smart contract build, test, optimize, and deploy guides across `README.md` and `docs/development-guide.md`.
- Updated `scripts/setup-local-node.sh` to check for Docker Compose and use it as default, falling back to raw `docker run` if compose is not present.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Initial project workspace setup with `pnpm` and `Turborepo`.
- Next.js 15 application workspace scaffolding in `apps/web`.
- TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and Husky configuration.
- Comprehensive GitHub Issue Templates, Pull Request Template, and Actions workflow (CI).
- Initial project documentation: README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP, SECURITY, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.
